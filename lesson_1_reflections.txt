How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    because the possible changes are visibles

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can restore your code in any moment

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    it makes the work easier but if we do this many times we will have a lot o version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because it's easier to know and manipulate the edited files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    with git log i can see all commits of that project and with git diff i can compare two of all commits of the project

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    its better because if you make a mistake you can return to another versions y try to avoid it o solve it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    maybe i would like to apply in a project
