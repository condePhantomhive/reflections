When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you are going to share your project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because only you know how is the working your project maybe you don't want to pull it until you finish some function.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    A branch its an extention in the same computer, a clone its a project that you copy in your computer from a repository and a fork its when you copy  a repository in your computer similar than clone but in this option you can colaborate in the project and you give the credit of creation to the autor.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can know if the project has changed since the last time you see it. So you can prevent conflict problems.
