When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you are going to share your project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because only you know how is the working your project maybe you don't want to pull it until you finish some function.
